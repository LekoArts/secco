Update [`yargs`](https://github.com/yargs/yargs) from `17.7.2` to `18.0.0`. yargs v18 now requires Node.js `^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0 || >=23` or later.

Since `secco` supported Node.js v18 in v2, this dependency update warrants a major update to update secco's `engines` key.

**Breaking change:** `secco` now requires Node.js `^20.19.0 || ^22.12.0 || >=23` or later. Once you update your Node.js version, you'll be able to use secco as before.
