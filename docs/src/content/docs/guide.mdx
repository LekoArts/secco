secco is a command-line tool for local development. It uses [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) and direct file copying to apply your latest changes to other projects.

When developing and maintaining (multiple) packages, it's a real hassle to use something like `npm link`. But you also don't want to publish your changes to npm's remote registry. Both have a lot of pitfalls as they might break on complicated dependency chains or symlinking.

secco solves these problems and streamlines the process of local package testing.

## Install secco

Using a global installation:

```shell
npm install --global secco
```

You can also use [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npx) to invoke it.

```shell
npx secco@latest --help
```

:::note

For secco to work correctly you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) 18 or later installed.

## Initialize a `.seccorc` file

In order to link the destination to your source ([terminology explainer](/guide/terminology/)), secco utitlizes its own `.seccorc` configuration file. This way you only need to provide that information once, on all consecutive runs `secco` automatically looks in the right spot.

<Steps>

1. Navigate to your destination and run the following command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    secco init
    ```

1. When the prompt asks, **"What is the absolute path to your source?"**, enter the absolute path to your source.

    ```shell
    ? What is the absolute path to your source?
    ✔ · /Users/username/repositories/ai-magic
    ```

1. The prompt will show you a summary of what `secco init` will do. When the prompt asks, **"Do you want to create the file?"**, enter **"Y"**.

</Steps>

You should have a new `.seccorc` file inside your destination.

:::caution

secco **requires** to either find a `.seccorc` file (with [`source.path`](/reference/config/#sourcepath) set) or that the [`SECCO_SOURCE_PATH`](/reference/config/#secco_source_path) environment variable is defined in the destination.

:::

## Start secco

**Before starting secco**, you should ensure that your source's entrypoints are available. This could mean that you have to compile your source files (ideally in watch mode). Otherwise `secco` won't find anything to copy over.

Inside your destination, start `secco` like so:

```shell
secco
```

secco will now scan your destination's `package.json` file and compare its `dependencies`/`devDependencies` with packages that it can find inside the source.

If necessary, secco publishes your source to a local Verdaccio registry. This won't happen every time (especially on consecutive runs) as secco then just uses file copying directly. When Verdaccio is used, the terminal prints this:

```shell
[Verdaccio] Starting server...
[Verdaccio] Started successfully!
Publishing ai-magic@1.0.0-secco-1697394661753 to local registry...
Published ai-magic@1.0.0-secco-1697394661753 to local registry
Installing packages from local registry:
 - ai-magic
✔ Installation finished successfully!
```

In any case, when secco copies over the files from the source to destination you'll discover a similar terminal output:

```shell
Copied index.mjs to node_modules/ai-magic/index.mjs
Copied package.json to node_modules/ai-magic/package.json
```

Now go back to your source, edit a file, and let the file be re-compiled. secco should copy over the new file into your destination again.
