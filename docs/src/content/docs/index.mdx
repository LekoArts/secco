## Features

<CardGrid>
	<Card title="File Sync & Package Publishing" icon="random">
		By default, changes will be copied over from the source into the destination's `node_modules` folder. If necessary, changes are published to a local [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/) registry first, so that you don't have to worry about symlinks or dependency hell.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Link Multiple Projects" icon="add-document">
		`secco` reads the `.seccorc` file to make the connection between destination and source. This allows you to use `secco` with as many source folders as you wish.
	</Card>
	<Card title="npm, yarn, and pnpm support" icon="setting">
		You can use any of these package managers in your source and destination projects.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Watch and CI mode" icon="forward-slash">
		By default, `secco` starts a watch task. But you can also only run it once, enabling CI End-To-End testing use cases.
